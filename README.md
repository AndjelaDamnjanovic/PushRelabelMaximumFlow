# Project Visual

This project is made by students of computer science at the Faculty of Mathematics, University of Belgrade for the Software developement course.<br><br>
It was made with the idea of helping the other students of our faculty with understanding and mastering the knowledge of graph algorithms.<br><br>
Using visual, the students can enter their own graph and run one of the algorithms that are supported by the program. As a result, steps of the algorithms will be displayed directly as the algorithm is running. <br><br>
To see how the developement of this project went, visit our <i>[Wiki pages](https://gitlab.com/matf-bg-ac-rs/course-rs/projects-2022-2023/03-visual/-/wikis/Home)</i>.

# Prerequisites:

## Downloading the Visual

To download our project Visual, you need to open the terminal and type `git clone https://gitlab.com/matf-bg-ac-rs/course-rs/projects-2022-2023/03-visual.git`, or, if that does not work, try typing `$ git clone https://gitlab.com/matf-bg-ac-rs/course-rs/projects-2022-2023/03-visual.git`<br>
When you type the command, the project will be cloned onto your local device. 

## Start with Qt
<ul>
<li>After downloading the QtCreator, open the application on your computer.<br></li>
<li>When you open the app, click on <i>Open project</i></li>
<li>Now, find a folder where the project is downloaded and open <i>graph.pro</i> file.</li>
<li>To build the project, click on the <i>Build</i> icon on the bottom left side of the screen.</li>
<li>When the project is built, run the project by clicking <i>Run</i> that is also located on the bottom left side of the screen.</li>
<li>The project is now running and you can use it.</li>
</ul>
