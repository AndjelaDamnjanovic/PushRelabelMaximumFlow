# Project Visual

This project is made by students of computer science at the Faculty of Mathematics, University of Belgrade for the Software developement course.<br><br>
It was made with the idea of helping the other students of our faculty with understanding and mastering the knowledge of graph algorithms.<br><br>
Using visual, the students can enter their own graph and run one of the algorithms that are supported by the program. As a result, steps of the algorithms will be displayed directly as the algorithm is running. <br><br>
To see how the developement of this project went, visit our [Wiki pages](https://gitlab.com/matf-bg-ac-rs/course-rs/projects-2022-2023/03-visual/-/wikis/Home)
